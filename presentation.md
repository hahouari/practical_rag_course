### Practical RAG: Building Specialized Chatbots Step-by-Step

### LLMs?

LLMs (or Large Language Models) are artificial intelligence models that are trained on large amounts of text data to generate human-like text.

---

### LLMs?

They are considered as general purpose AIs, unlike specialized AI models that are designed to perform specific tasks (e.g. Face Recognition, OCR, etc.).

---

### Quiz 1

**What is the primary purpose of Large Language Models (LLMs)?**

- a) To perform face recognition tasks
- b) To generate human-like text based on large amounts of data
- c) To scrape data from websites
- d) To analyze and process audio data

---

### Quiz 1 (Answers)

**What is the primary purpose of Large Language Models (LLMs)?**

- ❌ To perform face recognition tasks
- ✅ To generate human-like text based on large amounts of data
- ❌ To scrape data from websites
- ❌ To analyze and process audio data

---

### LLMs and Their Limitations

While LLMs are powerful, they have limitations:

- **Static Knowledge**: They are only trained on data available up to a certain point.
- **Large Size**: They require significant resources for fine-tuning or training.
- **Context Limitation**: They struggle to retrieve specific information efficiently (or hallucinate).

---

### Bridging the Gap: Why RAG?

To address these limitations, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines 2 steps:

1. **Retrieval Systems**: For fetching up-to-date, task-specific, or large-scale information on demand.
2. **LLMs**: For generating coherent and contextually relevant text.

This synergy enhances the effectiveness of AI systems in dynamic and specialized use cases.

### Why not Fine-Tuning?

Fine-tuning is a process of taking a pre-trained model to train it and tweak its parameters to perform better on a specific task. It is always more time-consuming and more expensive than RAG.

---

### Pros & Cons over Fine-Tuning

| RAG                  |     |     | Fine-Tuning           |
| -------------------- | --- | --- | --------------------- |
| No Training          | ✅  |     | Training required     |
| Up-to-Date           | ✅  |     | Can still be outdated |
| Easy to Switch Model | ✅  |     | Hard to Switch        |
| Retrieval Quality    | 👌  | 👌  | Training Quality      |
| Extra Retrieval Step |     | ✅  | Real-time             |

### Quiz 2

**Which of the following statements are true?**

- a) Fine-tuning can give outdated answer unlike RAG.
- b) Fine-tuning allows easy switching between models, while RAG requires retraining for each new model.
- c) RAG can be updated with new data more easily, while fine-tuning requires retraining the model.
- d) Fine-tuning is faster to implement than RAG since it doesn’t require retrieval systems.

### Components of RAG System

- Large Language Model (e.g. OpenAI GPT-3, Anthropic Sonnet, or Google Gemini) ✅ (Easy)
- Structured Data 🤔
- Embedding Model for Semantic Search
- Database with vector storage & search capabilities

---

### What is scraping & structuring data?

- Scraping: Extracting useful data from websites, PDFs, or APIs.
- Structuring Data: Converting scraped data into a structured format (e.g. JSON, CSV, XML, Class Objects, etc).

---

### Components of RAG System

- Large Language Model ✅
- Structured Data ✅
- Embedding Model for Semantic Search 🤔❔
- Database with vector storage & search capabilities ⏳

---

### Embedding Models? 🤔

They are specialized ML models that convert data (like text, images, or audio) into vectors (embeddings). These vectors allow us to perform semantic search.

---

### Databases with vector storage & search capabilities

Examples:

- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/9.1/en/vector.html) (9.1 or later), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/projects/mariadb-vector/) (11.7 or later)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (using [pgVector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector))
- [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/)
- [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/)
- [Milvus](https://milvus.io/)
